Dotnet Web Push example
=======================

This repo contains an example of web push notification with dotnet.

In order to use the project, you must set the Vapid subject and keys in `appsetting.json` in the WebUi project.

Please keep in mind that this is just a demo, do not use this in production, since the instance may not scale if you use auto generated keys.
